\end{figure}

Consider the circle packing shown in \Cref{fig:worst-case}. For these two circles, the surrounding square is the smallest one in which the circles can be packed. Originally, we considered the following problem: Does this instance constitute the worst case in terms of packing density, or is there a set of circles with the same combined area that cannot be packed into this square? Put differently, can all other sets of circles with the same combined area as these two
(like the one in \Cref{fig:big-question})
be packed into this specific square?
We will give a constructive proof that this is indeed the case.

\chapter{Preliminaries}

\section{Circle instances}

We start off with some definitions which make our life easier when talking about circles and circle instances:

\begin{definition}
    For each $0 \le a$, an \emph{$a$-circle} is a circle with an area of $a$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{circle instance} is a multiset of non-negative real numbers, which define the circles' areas. Addition of circle instances is defined like on multisets.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    For a circle instance $A$, $\mysum(A)$ is the combined area of the instance's circles.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    $\C$ is the set of all circle instances. $\C(a)$ consist of exactly those circle instances with a combined area of at most $a$. Finally, $\C(a,b)$ consists of exactly those circle instances $A \in \C(a)$, for which each circle in $A$ has an area of at least $b$.
\end{definition}

\chapter{Common techniques}

\section{Greedy splitting}

The core idea of the proposed packing algorithms is to repeatedly split the set of input circles into groups. The method which performs this splitting resembles a greedy scheduling algorithm. It is going to be important for the packing algorithm that the ratio of the groups' sizes is close to certain factors.

The algorithm, \textsc{Split}, takes two parameters: The first is an arbitrary circle instance $C$. The second is a tuple of positive factors, which determines which percentages of $C$'s total area should go into the respective groups. For example, if we wanted to split $C$ into equally sized halves, we could choose the tuple $(1,1)$, and if we wanted to split $C$ into four groups with the proportions 1:1:1:3, we could use $(1,1,1,3)$. We call this tuple the \emph{split key}:

\begin{definition}
    A \emph{split key} is a tuple of at least two positive real numbers.
\end{definition}

Of course, it will not always be possible to achieve this desired ratio exactly (for example if the input instance consists of few very large---or even only one---circle), but we can derive some properties from the resulting subinstances if the resulting group's sizes derive from the split key.

In each step, \textsc{Split} adds the largest remaining circle of the input instance to the “emptiest” group---the group where the ratio between the current total sum and the associated factor of the split key is the smallest. The scenario which is easiest to imagine is when the split key actually describes the desired total area of that group, and \textsc{Split} puts the next circle into the group which has the smallest “filling level”.

\begin{algorithm}[htbp!]
    \caption{\textsc{Split}$(C,F)$}
    \begin{algorithmic}
        \Require A circle instance $C$ and a split key $F = (f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n)$
        \Ensure Circle instances $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_n$
        \For{$i = 1$ to $n$}
            \State $C_i \gets \emptyset$
        \EndFor
        \State Sort $C$ descending by size
        \ForAll{$c \in C$}
            \State $j = \min_{1 \le i \le n} \frac{\mysum(C_i)}{f_i}$\Comment{Find the index of the emptiest instance}
            \State $C_j \gets C_j \cup \{c\}$
        \EndFor
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{theorem}\label{th:split-property}
    For any circle instance $C$ and any split key $F = (f_1, f_2, \dots, f_n)$, \textsc{Split}$(C,F)$ decomposes $C$ into $n$ circle instances with $C_0 + C_1 + \dots + C_n = C$.

    Define $r_i = \frac{\mysum(C_i)}{f_i}$ as the relative filling level of $C_i$.
    Set $r^* = \min\{r_0,r_1,\dots,r_n\}$.
    Then all $c \in C_i$ have a size of at least $f_i(r_i-r^*) = \mysum(C_i) - f_i r^*$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Assume for contradicion $C_i$ contained an element smaller than $f_i(r_i-r^*)$. All elements which were put into $C_i$ after that have to be at least as small, as the elements were sorted by descending size. So the last element put into $C_i$ (let us call it $c$) would be smaller than $f_i(r_i-r^*)$, as well.
    But this means that $\frac{\mysum(C_i) - c}{f_i} > \frac{\mysum(C_i) - f_i(r_i-r^*)}{f_i} = r_i - (r_i-r^*) = r^*$, meaning that at the moment $c$ was inserted, the relative filling level of $C_i$ would already have been larger than $r^*$, a contradiction to the algorithm's greedy nature, as \textsc{Split} would have put the element into a less filled instance in this situation.
\end{proof}

\section{Shapes}

We will state some general observations about shapes which are suitable to pack certain classes of circle instances. Most of the proofs appearing in later chapters which are tailored to specific kinds of shapes (triangles, squares), will use these quite universal theorems.

\begin{definition}
    For any $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \C$, a $\mathcal{C}$-shape is a shape in which each $C \in \mathcal{C}$ can be packed.
\end{definition}

For example, if a shape is a $\C(a)$-shape, it means that each circle instance with a total area of $a$ can be packed into the shape. That's an interesting property that we will hunt after for most of this thesis, as it means no matter how the instances divide the area $a$ into circles, they can all be packed into the shape.

%\begin{theorem}
%    A shape is a $\mathcal{C}$-shape, if, for a given decomposition method, for all possible decompositions $C_1, C_2, \dots, C_n$ of any $C \in \mathcal{C}$, one can always find $n$ shapes in which the resulting subinstances can be packed, and which fit into the original shape.
%\end{theorem}

%Here is a definition that makes it easier to talk about 

\begin{definition}\label{def:tangled}
    For any split key $F$ of length $n$, we say that a set of $n$ shapes is $F$-tangled, if all of them are $\C(a_i, a_i - f_i r^*)$-shapes, with $r^* = min\{\frac{a_i}{f_i}|i \in 1,2,\dots,n\}$.
\end{definition}

Note that having an $F$-tangled set of shapes basically means that they reflect the \textsc{Split}-algorithm's minimum element sizes stated in \Cref{th:split-property}. If a subinstance $C$ returned by \textsc{Split} can not possibly contain any circles smaller than a certain size, it makes sense to relax the requirements for the shapes: It is no longer necessary for them to pack arbitrary circle instances, but it suffices if they can pack those where the circles have a certain minimum size.

So, put differently, to have $F$-tangled shapes of the correct totals is a sufficient condition to be able to pack resulting subinstances of a \textsc{Split} operation into them. This is expressed in the following lemma:

%\begin{theorem}
%    A shape is a $\C(a,b)$-shape, if there is a split key $F$, so that for all $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n \le a$, one can find a $\C(a_1)$-shape, a $\C(a_2)$-shape, \dots, and a $\C(a_n)$-shape, which are $F$-tangled and fit into the original shape.
%\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}\label{th:split-tangle}
    Given an arbitrary $C \in \C(a,b)$ and a split key $F$, use \textsc{Split}$(C,F)$ to decompose $C$ into $n$ subinstances. Call the subinstances' totals $a_1$, $a_2$, \dots, $a_n$. If we find $n$ shapes, each of which is a $\C(a_i)$-shape, and these shapes are $F$-tangled, we can pack $C$ into the shapes.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    By \Cref{th:split-property}, \textsc{Split} only produces subinstance $C_i \in \C(a_i, (a_i, a_i-f_i r^*))$.
    As our shapes are $F$-tangled, by \Cref{def:tangled}, the $i$-th shape is a $\C(a_i, (a_i, a_i - f_i r^*))$-shape, so the $i$-th subinstance can be packed into the $i$-th shape.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    For a given shape, if there is an $F$ so that for all $a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_n \le a$ one can find $F$-tangled $\C(a_i, b)$-shapes which can be packed into the original shape, that shape is a $\C(a,b)$-shape.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Given an arbitrary $C \in \C(a,b)$, regardless of which totals \textsc{Split} produces, we know from \Cref{th:split-tangle} that we can always pack them into our $F$-tangled shapes. As these shapes also fit into the original shape, we know that we can pack $C$ into that shape.
\end{proof}

\section{Normalization}

In some proofs, we will normalize the instances, shapes, or figures in question. For example, we can scale all areas involved up by a factor of $f$, as long as we scale all lengths up by a factor of $\sqrt{f}$.

\chapter{Hats}

The packing algorithm will also involve a specific family of shapes, which can recursively be packed into each other. We call these shapes \emph{hats}:

\begin{definition}
    For each $0 \le b \le a$, an \emph{$(a,b)$-hat} is a non-acute triangle with an incircle of area $a$, whose corners are rounded to the radius of a $b$-circle (see \Cref{fig:hat}).
    %An $a$-hat is an $(a,0)$-hat.
    %If we say \emph{obtuse hat}, \emph{right hat}, or \emph{acute hat}, the hat is based on an obtuse/right/acute triangle.
\end{definition}

\begin{figure}[htbp!]
    \centering

    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
        \hatsimple
    \end{tikzpicture}

    \caption{An $(a,b)$-hat.}
    \label{fig:hat}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
    A hat's \emph{associated split key} equals the areas of the two circles incribed in the hat's two sides when splitting it orthogonal to its base through its tip.
\end{definition}

%%For the following proofs, we need to know a hat's dimensions in detail. We construct these measures using \Cref{fig:construction}.
%%
%%\begin{lemma}\label{lm:sizes}
%%    Let $r$ be the radius of an $a$-circle, and $s$ be the radius of a $b$-circle.
%%
%%    A ($a,b$)-hat has
%%    \begin{itemize}
%%        \item height $h(a) = \textcolor{blue}{r + r\s} = \sqrt{\frac a \pi}(1+\s)$,
%%        \item width $w(a,b) = 2\textcolor{blue}{(r+r\s)} - 2\textcolor{orange}{s\s} = \sqrt{\frac a \pi}(2+2\s)-\sqrt{\frac b \pi}2\s$,

%%
%%    We define two additional measures for the case when one of the corners is not rounded:

    \caption{Hat-in-hat packings for different split ratios}
    \label{fig:hatsinhat}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}\label{th:hatsinhat}
    For each $(a,0)$-hat with the associated split key $F$,
    %for $$f = \frac{1}{1+\frac{1+\cot(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{\alpha}{2}))^2}{(1+\cot(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{\beta}{2}))^2}}$$,
    any two $F$-tangled right hats with an incircle sum of at most $a$ can be packed into the hat.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Place the hats' tips at the bottom of the hat and push them as far to the left/right as possible, like in \Cref{fig:hatsinhat}.

    This placement constitutes a valid packing if (1) the hats do not overlap each other and (2) the hats fit into the hat individually.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(1)]
            We will first show that the hats do not overlap each other.

            To do so, we first normalize the container hat's width to 1 and make an observation about the partial widths $l$ and $r$ in \Cref{fig:hatlr}: If the top angle is a right angle, the partial widths have the same lengths as the triangle's two cathetus $x$ and $y$, so $l^2 + r^2 = 1$. If the top angle is obtuse, but the incircle's center stays at the same $x$-coordinate (like the dotted variant), both $l$ and $r$ shrink, so for each hat, $l^2 + r^2 \le 1$.

            \begin{figure}[htbp!]
                \centering

                \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
                    \hatlr{60}{30}{51}{25}
                \end{tikzpicture}

                \caption{$l^2 + r^2 \le 1$ holds for each non-acute triangle}
                \label{fig:hatlr}
            \end{figure}

            We then observe that the hats to be packed don't overlap if their incircles don't overlap, which is true if in \Cref{fig:hatsoverlap}, $lf + rg \le 1$ holds. Also note that for \emph{similar} hats, the ratio between their incircle's area and the square of their widths is constant. This means that if $a_1 + a_2 = a$, $f^2 + g^2 = 1$.

            \begin{figure}[htbp!]
                \centering

                \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
                    \hatsoverlap{45}{30}{0.7}{0}
                \end{tikzpicture}

                \caption{$f^2 + g^2 = 1$ for each non-acute triangle}
                \label{fig:hatsoverlap}
            \end{figure}

            Thus:

            \begin{align*}
                lf + rg
                &\le lf + \sqrt{1-l^2} \sqrt{1-f^2}\\
                &= lf + \sqrt{(1-l^2)(1-f^2)}\\
                &= lf + \sqrt{1 - f^2 - l^2 + l^2f^2}\\
                &\le lf + \sqrt{1 - 2lf + l^2f^2}\tag{\theequation}\label{eq:am-gm}\\
                &= lf + \sqrt{(1-lf)^2}\\
                &= 1
            \end{align*}

            Line \ref{eq:am-gm} is a consequence of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means.

        \item[(2)]
            It is left to show that the hats fit inside the container individually.

            If a hat's area $a_i \le f_i$, its incircle is at most as big as the incircle of the container hat's side, so it will fit inside without question.

            \begin{figure}[htbp!]
                \centering

                \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=3]
                    \hatpoke{40}{50}{0.6}{0}
                \end{tikzpicture}

                \caption{}
                \label{fig:hatpoke}
            \end{figure}

            So let's assume $a_i > f_i$. For this proof, normalize $a$ to 1. The hat fits into the container hat individually if

            $$\sqrt{a} - (1-\sqrt{f})\sqrt{y} \le \sqrt{f}$$

            As the relative filling level of this hat is higher than that of the other one, this hat is rounded by $y = a - f\frac{1-a}{1-f}) = \frac{a(1-f)-f(1-a)}{1-f} = \frac{a-f}{1-f}$. $z = a-f$.

            $$\sqrt{f+z} - (1-\sqrt{f})\sqrt{\frac{z}{1-f}} \le \sqrt{f}$$

            Substitute $f = b^2$ and $z = c^2$.

            $$\sqrt{b^2+c^2} - (1-b)\frac{c}{\sqrt{1-b^2}} \le b$$

            Bring the subtrahend to the right and square both sides.

            $$b^2+c^2 \le b^2 + \frac{2b(1-b)c}{\sqrt{1-b^2}} + (1-b)^2\frac{c^2}{1-b^2}$$

            Subtract $b^2$, divide by $c$ and rearrange.

            $$c\frac{(1-b^2)-(1-b)^2}{\sqrt{1-b^2}} \le \frac{(1-b^2)-(1-b)^2}{\sqrt{1-b^2}}\sqrt{1-b^2}$$

            $$c \le \sqrt{1-b^2} \iff c^2 \le 1-b^2 \iff z \le 1-f$$
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{th:roundedhatsinhat}
    For each $(a,b)$-hat with the associated split key $F$,
    %for $$f = \frac{1}{1+\frac{1+\cot(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{\alpha}{2}))^2}{(1+\cot(\frac{\pi}{4}-\frac{\beta}{2}))^2}}$$,
    for each $a_1 + a_2 = a$, there are two $F$-tangled right hats, where one is an $(a_1,b)$-hat and the other an $(a_2,b)$-hat, which can be packed into the hat.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The container's corners are now rounded to the radius of a $b$-circle, and we need to show that the two hats from the previous construction still fit inside. But the all corners of the contained hats are also rounded to (at least) the same radius, so they will never overlap the container, see \Cref{fig:rounding-hats}.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    An $(a,b)$-hat is a $\C(a,b)$-shape.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Given a circle instance $C \in \C(a,b)$, if it only consists of a single circle, it cannot be larger than the incircle of the $(a,b)$-hat, so it can be packed.

    Otherwise, by \Cref{th:roundedhatsinhat} and \Cref{th:split-tangle}, it follows directly that the hat is a $\C(a,b)$-shape.

    For any non-acute triangle with an incircle of area $a$, for any $b > a$ there are instances in $\C(b)$ which cannot be packed into the triangle.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The instance $\{b\}$ cannot be packed, as the incircle is by definition the largest circle which fits into the triangle.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
    A non-acute triangle with an incircle of area $a$ is an $\C(a)$-shape.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The triangle is an $(a,0)$-hat, which is an $\C(a)$-shape.
\end{proof}

%\begin{theorem}
%    Each $A \in \C(a)$ can be packed into an isosceles triangle with a largest angle $\gamma$ between $\frac{\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{\pi}{3}$ and an area of $a\frac{1+\frac{1}{\sin(\gamma)}}{\pi}$.
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{theorem}
%    For any $0 < x$ and $0 < y$, there are always 
%    a $(x+z)$-hat and a
%    Each $A \in \C(a)$ can be packed into an obtuse triangle with an incircle of area $a$.

%Finally, we can bring the \textsc{Split} algorithm and the properties of the hat shapes together and give constructive proofs for the existence of circle packings:

\chapter{Squares}

\begin{lemma}
    If the circle instance shown in \Cref{fig:b} has a combined area of $a$, the square has an area of $\frac{3+2\s}{\pi}a \approx 1.85525a$. Call this worst-case factor $\Psi$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Note that because a circle of radius $r$ has an area of $a = \pi r^2$, an $a$-circle has a radius of $r = \sqrt{\frac a \pi}$. Then, by construction as seen in \Cref{fig:b}:

    $$\Psi a = \left(2r + 2\frac{r}{\s}\right)^2 = r^2\left(2+\s\right)^2 = \frac{\frac a 2}{\pi}\left(4+4\s+2\right) = \frac{3+2\s}{\pi}a$$
\end{proof}

Our problem can now be expressed like this: Can all circle instances $A \in \C(a)$ be packed into a square with an area of $\Psi a$? This will be \Cref{th:circlesinsquare}, and the rest of this paper will build up to its proof.


\begin{theorem}\label{th:circlesinsquare}
    A square with an area of $\frac{3+2\s}{\pi} a$ is a $\C(a)$-shape.
\end{theorem}

%\begin{theorem}\label{th:hatsinsquare}
%    For any $0 \le x \le y$, an $x$-hat and a $(y,y-x)$-hat can always be packed into a square with an area of $\Psi(x+y)$.
%\end{theorem}
%
%\begin{proof}
%    Place the tips of the hats in two opposing corners of the square, like in \Cref{fig:hatsinsquare}.
%    This placement constitues a valid packing if (1) the hats fit into the square individually and (2) the hats do not overlap.
%
%    \begin{itemize}
%        \item[(1)]
%            The hats fit into the square individually if their diagonal never gets larger than the square's edge length $\sqrt{\Psi(x+y)} = \frac{1+\s}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{x+y}$.
%            As $x \le \frac {x+y} 2$, \Cref{lm:sizes} directly tells us that the $x$-hat has a diagonal of at most
%            \begin{align*}
%                d(x,0) \le d(\frac{x+y}{2},0) = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{x+y}{2}}{\pi}}(2+\s) + 0 = \sqrt{\Psi(x+y)}
%            \end{align*}
%
%            As for the $(y,y-x)$-hat, its diagonal is also never larger than $\sqrt{\Psi(x+y)}$: \todo[inline]{algebraic proof TBD :-)}
%
%            \begin{tikzpicture}
%                \begin{axis}[height=5cm,xtick={0,0.5},xlabel=$\frac{x}{x+y}$,domain=0:0.5,legend pos=outer north east,no markers,samples=500]
%                    \addplot[red,thick] {sqrt((1-x)/pi)*(2+sqrt(2))-sqrt((1-2*x)/pi)*sqrt(2)};
%                    \addplot[blue,thick] {(1+sqrt(2))/sqrt(pi)};
%                    \legend{$\frac{d{(y,y-x)}}{\sqrt{x+y}}$,$\sqrt{\Psi}$}
%                \end{axis} 
%            \end{tikzpicture}
%
%            %\begin{align*}
%            %    d(y,y-x)
%            %    &= \sqrt{\frac{y}{\pi}}(2+\s)-\sqrt{\frac{y-x}{\pi}}\s\\
%            %    &\le \sqrt{\frac{\frac{x+y}{2}}{\pi}}(2+\s)-\sqrt{\frac{y-y}{\pi}}\s\\
%            %    &= \frac{1+\s}{\sqrt{\pi}}\sqrt{x+y} = \sqrt{\Psi(x+y)}
%            %\end{align*}
%
%        \item[(2)]
%            The hats don't overlap if their combined height never exceeds $\sqrt{2\Psi(x+y)}$, the square's diagonal:
%            \begin{align*}
%                h(x) + h(y)
%                &= \sqrt{\frac{x}{\pi}}(1+\s) + \sqrt{\frac{y}{\pi}}(1+\s)\\
%                &= \frac{1+\s}{\sqrt\pi}(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y})\\
%                &\le \frac{1+\s}{\sqrt\pi}(\sqrt{2x+2y})\\
%                &= \s\frac{1+\s}{\sqrt\pi}\sqrt{x+y} = \sqrt{2\Psi(x+y)} \qedhere
%            \end{align*}
%    \end{itemize}
%\end{proof}

%\begin{proof}
%    If $A$ only consists of a single $a$-circle, it can be placed at the center of the square, as its diameter of $2\sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi}} \approx 1.12838\sqrt{a}$ is smaller than the squares edge length $\sqrt{\Psi a} \approx 1.36207\sqrt{a}$. Otherwise, by \Cref{th:split-property}, \textsc{Split} decomposes $A$ into $X \in \C(x)$ and $Y \in \C(y,y-x)$. By \Cref{th:circlesinhat}, we can pack $X$ into a $x$-hat and $Y$ into a $(y,y-x)$-hat. By \Cref{th:hatsinsquare}, we can pack those two hats into the square.
%
%    See \Cref{fig:example} for a complete example packing.
